            5. Dormant and inactive accounts
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-3">
            We want to keep the Service reliable and fairly priced for active
            users. Accounts that are not on an active paid subscription and show
            little or no meaningful use may be reviewed and marked as dormant.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            An account may be considered for dormancy if, for example, it has
            not been used in more than twelve (12) months, including no
            sign-in, no updates to profile content, and no engagement with the
            profile through the Service. Dormancy is applied at the account
            level. When an account is marked dormant, associated profiles are
            typically removed from our public directory and may lose other
            inactive-account privileges, while we retain the data for a limited
            period in accordance with our retention practices.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            Dormant accounts that remain unused may eventually be permanently
            deleted, along with their profile content and related data. We may
            delete dormant accounts without further notice once our internal
            retention period has passed. Active subscribers and accounts in good
            standing with ongoing use are not subject to this process.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            If you believe your account was marked dormant in error, or you wish
            to restore access, please contact us through our Help page. Tell us
            the email or username associated with the account and briefly
            describe your situation.
